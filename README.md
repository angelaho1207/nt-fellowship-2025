# Objective
My research aims to evaluate the effectiveness of lightweight CNNs (< 1 million parameters) with learnable zero-sum kernels and lightweight CNNs with fixed Laplacian kernels at detecting lung CT scans and breast MRI scans that were tampered using deep learning techniques (CT-GAN & stable diffusion).
